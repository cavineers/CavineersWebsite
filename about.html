We
                        have recently submitted a plan to reopen our workshop to students. Due to the pandemic, we are taking extreme precautions to ensure the safety of everyone! While in the workshop, masks are required at all times (along with safety
                        goggles). We have assigned seating and working areas to ensure proper distancing and contract tracing can happen. We have divided our team into 3 groups who alternate through the workshop (with full online being an option) to limit
                        the number of people in person. Temperature checks are conducted to each person who enters the workspace. CDC approved cleaning occurs before and after each meeting with a deep cleaning day in between meetings. All students and
                        staff are remaining distant and we are prepared to return to full online at any time! All mentors are being asked to visit and assist online until further notice. We know these procedures will help to ensure safety and hope to
                        see everyone back in the workshop really soon.
