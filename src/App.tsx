                            information="Geoff is the Cavineer's most recent robot. Geoff (gee-off), is designed with a grabber made of shape-optimized polycarbonate and holds both cargo and hatches with a pneumatic claw so that the robot performs exceptionally well without losing any style points. Geoff has a West Coast drivetrain, with a drop-center and Omni wheels in the back to assist with pivoting. Shifting gearboxes allow Geoff to play a mean defense. The elevator is a step-up from its sibling, Fahrenheit, allowing for the grabber to flip back and forth through the middle. Geoff's elevator is also capable of lifting both hatches and cargo to all levels of the rocket. Winning Chairman's and playing in the finals at the Oxon Hill district event, Geoff was a force to be reckoned with. Geoff won the Chesapeake District Championship and made it to the semi-finals of the Daly field at the World Championships."

Thanks to its cascading elevator, coded with cascading PIDs; carbon fiber grabber; West Coast drivetrain, complete with shifting gearboxes; and the last minute addition of a climber, this robot brought us our best season yet. With a robust design, combined with its 10 different autonomous paths to choose from, we were not only chosen for an alliance at the World Championships, but also won the Archimedes sub-division in Detroit, Michigan.

Our robot was specifically a gear robot and used an active gear placement that never failed to place the gear on its peg. Our climber, although it screamed like a banshee, was so fast that we were able to continue placing gears all the way until the last seconds of the match, making us a great addition to any team. Our rope and climber each had different sides of velcro to allow for a strong grip on the rope and contributed to our rapid climb."

The objective was to pass 2ft diameter yoga balls between robots and then launch them into wall goals. Kevin had two main components to pick up pass or shoot the large ball. The Intake mechanism was a direct motor mount to axle system that allowed a lot of torque to pick up the ball from the ground.
