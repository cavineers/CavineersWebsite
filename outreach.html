                        <p>The Catholic Robotics League (or CRL for short) is a unification of the schools in the Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore through robotics/STEM. CRL was founded in 2017 through the efforts of 4541 and has helped expand both STEM
                            and FIRST in our community. The goal of CRL is to inspire, develop, support, and engage competitive robotics teams within the Catholic school system. We do this by providing financial assistance and networking opportunities
                            for students, teachers, coaches, and mentors to foster camaraderie, competition, and compassion within our community. Within the Catholic Robotics League, we host scrimmages, workshops, STEM nights, robot demonstrations, expositions,
                            and community service events.</p>

                        <p>A responsibility we are taking as a team is the mentoring of FIRST teams in the Catholic Robotics League. Within our program, we send small groups of our members to middle/elementary schools in the Archdiocese of Baltimore to guide
                            teams and new coaches in their build and competition seasons. Mentorship in the CRL makes FIRST more accessible to schools that don’t have robotics because it allows STEM teachers and school administrators to feel that there’s
                            no risk in starting a FIRST team. Through this program, we can directly interact with the schools we serve and this allows us to provide resources like technology, information, and experience to member schools.

                        <p>We demonstrate our robots throughout the year whether it be a competition bot at an Elementary School STEM night or our T-shirt cannon bot at our football games. We try to present our robots as much as possible to raise awareness
                            of the possibilities that technology offers. We often are invited to schools in the Catholic Robotics League to explain how our robots work and to let the kids interact with our bots.
